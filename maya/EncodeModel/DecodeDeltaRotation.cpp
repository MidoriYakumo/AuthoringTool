%
% convert model in relative rotation encoding to one that uses absolute rotations
%
% input         input model in relative rotation encoding - generated, e.g., with fullenc
% neigh         (k x 3) for every triangle the indices of its neighbours
% direction     global rotations that are set (default [0;0;0])
% landmarks     triangle indices that are constrained (default 1)
% weight        weights for constrained triangles (default 1)
% replacefaces  indices of faces that are replaced before decoding (default [])
% replacewith   replace the faces with this data
% usemex        use mex file for decoding (default 0)
%
% e.g. fully decode model given by PCA coefficients and show it
%
% dec = decdeltarot(coeffs * projected(:,1) + avg, neigh);
% r = reconstructmodel(dec, faces, reconmean);
% showmodel(r, faces, 'b');
