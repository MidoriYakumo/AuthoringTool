# High Concepts
The project is to create a very convenient tool that could allow users conveniently __adjust body pose and shape__ to their desired effects. Users only need to adjust a small set of parameters, such as __weight__ and __height__, and could get very satisfactory results .

# Language/Third Party Library
* C++ for main algorithm implementation and MEL for UI development.
* Eigen Library added to deal with matrix calculation.

# Algorithms and Techniques Used
* Automatic Rigging
* Relative Rotation Encoding
* PCA(Principal Component Analysis)
* Regression
* Relative Rotation Decoding
